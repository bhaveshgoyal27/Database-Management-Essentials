Conversion rules
Use the entity type rule to convert each entity type
Use the 1-M relationship rule for all relationships
Use  the M-N relationship rule (not needed).
Use the identification dependency rule to make LoanNo a component of the PK of DisburseLine. The PK of the DisburseLine table is a combination of LoanNo and DateSent. A not null constraint is not needed for DisburseLine.LoanNo because this column is part of the primary key of DisburseLine.
